A Vibration Sensing Device Using a 6-axis IMU and an Optimized Beam Structure for Activity Monitoring

In this repository the matlab code is provided for the articel "A Vibration Sensing Device Using a 6-axis IMU and an
Optimized Beam Structure for Activity Monitoring". The DOI will be provided, when the paper is accepted.

The provided files are used to read IMU data and analyze it with regards to the experimental measurements described in the article. Furthermore, the sensor fusion algorithm is contained in the function "waveletResonanceSensorFusion.m". Due to the large file size, the IMU measurements cannot be provided here. But we are happy to provide them upon request to the following e-mail: pieter.try@w-hs.de 

In the folder "Figure_And_Results" some results are showcased and some alternative illustrations.
